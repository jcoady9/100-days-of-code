# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a method to to delete that deletes the directory of the virtual environment and finished implementing a method for listing all the environments in the database. Also did a little refactoring for exception handling when starting subprocesses

**Thoughts:** Should be done with the actual functionality in the next day or two. I need to figure out how to create the GUI. I'll probably go with Tkinter since its already built in to the standard library.

### Day 1: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got started on a GUI application for managing all the virtual environments I've created recently. Decided to make a class for handling the actual managing of the virtual environments. Also implemented a method for creating new virtual environments.

**Thoughts:** Overall this is looking to be a simple project, had to refresh my memory a bit with using sqlite and python but otherwise no real issues.
