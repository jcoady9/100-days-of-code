# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got started on a GUI application for managing all the virtual environments I've created recently. Decided to make a class for handling the actual managing of the virtual environments. Also implemented a method for creating new virtual environments.

**Thoughts:** Overall this is looking to be a simple project, had to refresh my memory a bit with using sqlite and python but otherwise no real issues.
